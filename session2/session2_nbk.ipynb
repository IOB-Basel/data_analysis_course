    "## Exercise 4: Test hard vs. adaptable thresholds on percent_mito\n",
    "\n",
    "Many papers use hardcoded, manual thresholds on QC metrics such as percent_mito, either opting for the field convention for the sample type (e.g. 5%) or by visually inspecting QC scatterplots. This method is easy to use and reproduce, but the one-size-fits all approach is likely to fail beyond small experiments with few samples of a similar makeup (e.g. generating an atlas of healthy mouse retinas at the same age)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option, which may be beneficial in complex experiments, is to use an adaptable threshold learned from the sample itself. Due to the violation of common distributional assumptions in QC metrics, we usually use a robust statistical approach to avoid making any distributional assumptions. This method allows us to set a bespoke threshold for every sample and account for differences due to biology or batch, e.g., a higher mitochondrial threshold for degenerating samples. However, it still assumes a singular underlying distribution for the QC metric, which may be unsuitable for highly heterogeneous samples that might exhibit instead an e.g. bimodal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For adaptable thresholds, we often use median absolute deviation (MAD) based thresholding, as the median is a more robust statistic than the mean. This involves calculating a threshold as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$MAD = median( |X_{i} - median(X_{i})| )$    \n",
    "$threshold = median \\pm multiplier * MAD * 1.4826$\n",
    "\n",
    "The factor of 1.4826 allows the MAD to be comparable to a z-score for a normal distribution. Often, a multiplier of 3 is used to mimic the commonly used z-score threshold of 3. Note that it's also possible to adjust the \"harshness\" of an adaptable threshold by setting the multiplier, similarly to the z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mix of hard and adaptable thresholds can be used - setting hard thresholds on the number of genes and reads (taking splicing into account) while setting an adaptable mitochondrial read threshold is the default setting of `sc_pipe_iob`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will set manual thresholds for `n_transcripts_per_cell` and `n_genes_per_cell`, while testing both a manual threshold and a MAD-based threshold for `percent_mito`. For the first two QC metrics, we are interested in a lower bound to filter empty or very dying-adjacent cells with low values. For the latter, we want to construct an upper bound, after which we filter cells that may be dying."
