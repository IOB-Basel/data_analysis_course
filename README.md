# Data Analysis Course

This repository contains materials for the Data Analysis Course taught by Scientific Computing.

## Materials and repository organization

- `envs/*.yaml`: Conda environment specifications
- `session<#>`: Notebooks, scripts, and materials provided for each session
- `work/`: Your personal workspace â€” where you can copy and modify materials for your own analysis

### Why use the `work/` directory?

To avoid conflicts and accidental changes to shared course materials, we recommend that you copy files from each `session<#>/` folder into your `work/` directory before working on them.

#### Example
If you're working on Session 2, you can copy the materials like this:

```bash
cp -r session2/ work/session2/
```
